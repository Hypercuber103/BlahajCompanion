# BlÃ¥haj Bot - Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: 01/31/2025_

Your privacy is important to us. This document explains what data BlÃ¥haj Bot processes and how we handle it.

## 1. Information We Collect
BlÃ¥haj Bot **does not collect, store, or share** personal user data. However, some temporary data may be processed, such as:
- **Usernames & IDs** (for commands like `!hug`, but not stored)
- **Messages** (only to process commands, but never logged)

## 2. How We Use Data
- Data is **only used in real-time** to respond to commands.
- We **do not** store, sell, or share any user information.

## 3. Third-Party Services
- BlÃ¥haj Bot runs on **Discordâ€™s API**, meaning messages sent in Discord are subject to **Discordâ€™s Privacy Policy**.
- If hosted on platforms like **GitHub, Heroku, or Railway**, their privacy policies apply.

## 4. User Control & Data Removal
Since we **do not store** user data, there is nothing to request for deletion.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy at any time. If significant changes occur, we will announce them in the botâ€™s support server.
